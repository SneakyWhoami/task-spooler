This is a fork of `ts` (task spooler by Llu√≠s Batlle i Rossell)

The purpose of this fork is only to add GNU/Autotools support
and some helper to build packages (Debian and homebrew)
not to modify or add features to the program.

If you experience any problem with the binaries generated
from this fork please try also the mainstream, if the problem
is only in the fork feel free to contact me.

Alex <raziel@eml.cc>

note: some outdated docs and files not useful to the build
      have been moved into a directory legacy/
      this directory will be updated according to the mainstram
      but isn't included with distributed packages
      if you need some look into the fork repository
