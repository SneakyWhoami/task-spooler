ts for Debian
-------------

The only difference with the mainstream package is that this version
is compiled by default with -O2 instead of -O0 (may be changed setting
env CFLAGS=-O0 at configure time.


Please if you experience problems using this package contact me,
(the maintainer of this Debian package, not the author of the program.
